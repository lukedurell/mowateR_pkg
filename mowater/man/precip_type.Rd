\description{
The precipitation type data set is a collection of data on weather
conditions across the continental United States and Alaska.
Precipitation type is important because certain types of
even moderate amounts can have a dramatic impact on public safety.
There are 18 years of data. At weather stations, one of four
precipitation types is observed: Rain, Snow, Ice Pellets, or
Freezing Rain.  At each weather station where a precipitation was
observed, the corresponding grid box (in space and time) of a numerical
weather prediction model is obtained. Then, the vertical temperature
profile from that grid box is extracted. The shape and position (relative
to the freezing temperature) of the vertical temperature profile
generally determines the type of precipitation that is observed.
